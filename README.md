# Restaurant_Review
Natural Language Processing Project

This is a Natural Language Processing Project, In this project I have used the dataset from "SuperDataScience" website. The dataset has 1000 Restaurant reviews, The data set is a balanced dataset with (670) positive and (450) negative reviews. I used NLTK package to make reviews machine readable and then applied different classification models and compared their performance.
Task:
1. To classify the review as negative or positive.
2. Find out the best classification model for review classification

Future work:

Machine learning techniques like dimentionality reduction can be used to increase the performance of the models, in this project I have just used the basic models.Different models like 
CART
C5.0
Maximum Entropy  can be used to get more accurate results.
